## Usage

```swift
import Pickle
```

The usage is similiar to `UIImagePickerController`:

```swift
let picker = ImagePickerController()
picker.delegate = self as? ImagePickerControllerDelegate
present(picker, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

Display preselected images:

```swift
let assets: [PHAsset] = []
let picker = ImagePickerController(selectedAssets: assets)
```

`ImagePickerController` will request permission to access **Photos** if needed when it's presented.

### Delegate

`ImagePickerControllerDelegate` is responsible for dismissing the image picker. Required delegate methods:

```swift
/// Asks the delegate if the image picker should launch camera with certain permission status.
func imagePickerController(_ picker: ImagePickerController, shouldLaunchCameraWithAuthorization status: AVAuthorizationStatus) -> Bool

/// Tells the delegate that the user picked image assets. The delegate is responsible for dismissing the image picker.
func imagePickerController(_ picker: ImagePickerController, didFinishPickingImageAssets assets: [PHAsset])

/// Tells the delegate that the user cancelled the pick operation. The delegate is responsible for dismissing the image picker.
func imagePickerControllerDidCancel(_ picker: ImagePickerController)
```

### Appearance

Customize the appearance with a modified `Parameters` struct, or any type that conforms to `ImagePickerConfigurable`.

```swift
var parameters = Pickle.Parameters()
parameters.allowedSelections = .limit(to: 4)
let picker = ImagePickerController(configuration: parameters)
```

See [ImagePickerConfigurable.swift](https://github.com/carousell/pickle/blob/master/Pickle/Classes/ImagePickerConfigurable.swift) for a full list of configurable properties.

### Camera

`UIImagePickerController` with `sourceType = .camera` is used as the default camera on devices. Launch a customized camera from the image gallery by providing a [`CameraCompatible`](https://github.com/carousell/pickle/blob/master/Pickle/Classes/CameraCompatible.swift) type or a closure that returns a configured camera controller instance.

```swift
let picker = ImagePickerController(
  selectedAssets: [],
  configuration: Pickle.Parameters(),
  cameraType: UIImagePickerController.self
)
```

```swift
let initializer = {
  return UIImagePickerController()
}

let picker = ImagePickerController(
  selectedAssets: [],
  configuration: Pickle.Parameters(),
  camera: initializer
)
```
